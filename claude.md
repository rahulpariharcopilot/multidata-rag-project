# Multi-Source RAG + Text-to-SQL Project - Implementation Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21
**Current Status:** ALL PHASES COMPLETE - Production-Ready System Fully Deployed
**Current Phase:** Project Complete - All 6 Phases Finished + Lambda IPv4 Fix

---

## 📊 Project Status

### Quick Overview
- **Project Type:** Multi-Source RAG with Text-to-SQL capabilities
- **Approach:** Minimal MVP with incremental feature additions
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (14-16 days estimated)
- **Progress:** 100% COMPLETE - All 6 Phases Finished (Foundation + RAG + SQL + Routing + Evaluation + Polish + Docker)

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Vector Database:** Pinecone (instead of ChromaDB)
   - Cloud-hosted, managed service
   - No local storage needed
   - Requires account setup and index creation (dimension=1536)

2. **Development Approach:** Minimal MVP first
   - Start with core functionality
   - Layer features incrementally
   - Docker deployment deferred to end

3. **Package Versions:** Use latest stable versions
   - Verify from PyPI during installation
   - Use DeepWiki MCP for latest documentation
   - Original plan had deprecated versions

4. **Database Connection:** Supabase Session Pooler (IPv4)
   - AWS Lambda doesn't support IPv6 outbound connections
   - Use Session Pooler instead of Direct Connection
   - Connection format: `postgres.{project-ref}@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com`
   - IPv4-proxied for Lambda compatibility

5. **External Services Status:** All configured
   - OpenAI: ✅ Configured
   - Pinecone: ✅ Configured (rag-documents, vanna-sql-training)
   - Supabase: ✅ Configured (Session Pooler for IPv4)
   - OPIK: ✅ Configured

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **DeepWiki MCP Usage:**
   - Use for fetching latest package documentation during implementation
   - Verify API changes from original plan
   - Get current best practices

2. **Package Version Strategy:**
   - Verify all package versions from PyPI before installing
   - Original plan has deprecated versions - update to latest stable
   - Document version choices in requirements.txt

3. **Pinecone Setup:**
   - Must create index BEFORE implementing Phase 1
   - Index dimension: 1536 (matches OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - Use cosine similarity metric

4. **TODO Management:**
   - Update this file's TODO section as tasks complete
   - Use TodoWrite tool during implementation for granular tracking
   - Keep this file minimal but comprehensive
